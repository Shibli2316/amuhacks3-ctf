    <h1>CSS AMU Capture the Flag 2024 Official Rules</h1>
    <br /><br />
    <h2>CONTEST IS OPEN TO RESIDENTS OF INDIA.</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
        This Contest consists of only one event: the cybersecurity exercise (the
        “main stage”). <br /><br />
        The main stage will consist of an online contest where participating
        teams will compete to solve a set of challenges in a fast-paced setting.
        The contest will be recorded and the recording will be published for
        educational purposes. Selected parts of the contest might be published
        live. <br /><br />

        Term of the main stage: The Contest begins at 5:00:00 P.M. on **May 2,
        2024,* and ends at 8:00:00 P.M. on **May 2 2024* (“Contest Period”).
        ENTRANTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE CORRESPONDING TIME ZONE IN
        THEIR RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS. <br /><br />

        Eligibility: The Contest is open to individuals who are (1) over the age
        of eighteen (18) at the time of entry; (2) a resident of India; (3) an
        individual who is not restricted by applicable export controls and
        sanctions programs; and (4) people who have registered at
        https://forms.gle/uVPUtDfGvHsnoNy59. CSS AMU reserves the right to
        verify eligibility and to adjudicate on any dispute at any time.
        <br /><br />

        Participants may work in groups; however, the prize money will be
        awarded solely to the person whose email is listed on the team captain
        registration. It is the sole responsibility of the registrant to
        distribute any potential winnings. CSS AMU takes no liability for the
        distribution of payment to other group members. By entering you agree to
        be bound by these Official Rules and that all decisions of CSS AMU are
        final. <br /><br />

        Rewards for Points Accumulated: There will be a scoreboard where points
        will be assigned at the end of the competition based on the challenges
        that were completed. Each challenge will have several points based on
        the number of teams that solved it. Winners will be selected based on
        the greatest number of points earned. In case of a tie, the team with
        the earlier submission of the last flag will be the winner. <br /><br />

        After the main stage, CSS AMU will select those teams that have earned
        the 2 highest points scores. On or about May 2 2024 these potential
        winner(s) will be notified by email. <br /><br />

        If no entries are received, no prize will be awarded. Determinations of
        the judges are final and binding. <br /><br />

        Privacy: CSS AMU will be collecting personal data about participants
        when they register and enter the Contest. CSS AMU will treat this data
        under its privacy policy. <br /><br />

        Main Stage Prize: First-place winner will receive Prize money and
        goodies worth 800 INR . The second-place winner will receive Prize money
        and goodies worth 500 INR. Prizes may be subject to terms, restrictions
        and conditions imposed by CSS AMU. Further, all prize winners will need
        to provide all requested personal information to prove residence
        eligibility. <br /><br />
